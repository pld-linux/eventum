- use system Smarty (bundled one is identical version)
- separate distribution specific config (core.php) and installation
  specific config (config.php), so it would be possible to have at
  least some kind of updates to file paths
- raise php version requirement to 4.2.0, not to create wrapper is_a()
  function in config
- allow installation with php5 (never tested altho)
